Currently a proof of concept, Bowden aims to be the application athletes can use to plan their race season and then accurately record training workouts with the help of "playlists". During training Bowden can also suggest upcoming workouts or modifications to existing work load based on the Block Periodization method. 

### Discovering Races & Events
For athletes, planning a race season each year is a serious process. The first step is to commit to at least one race this season. This will be your A race, the more competitive folks also have B and C races to help prepare.

Bowden assists in this process by providing users with an interactive map of various races throughout North America. Once you sign up on a race's website you can mark it in Bowden as as "registered" and label it A (priority race), B, or C.

### Training Program
Once a race date has been provided Bowden can help plan the training season using Block Periodization or let you enter in your own workouts. With Bowden's Block Periodization Algorithm athletes can trust that recommended workouts are based on research backed method of adapting to be fit for race day.

### Record Workouts & Playlists
Most watches and fitness trackers leave a lot to be desired when it comes to recording a gym session or any workout that isn't just cardio. Bowden aims to solve this with a database of individual exercises that can be mixed together to form a "workout playlist". 

## Bonus Feature
AI audio coach. Using AI voice generation the user can upload a 2min sound bite of any voice they would like to have as a coach during a workout.
