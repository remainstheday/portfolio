Bowden is a prototype I'm developing that aims to be an all-in-one application for planning, training, and recording a hybrid race season.
It is built as a desktop app with companion iOS and Apple Watch apps.

### Race Discovery

The first step is to commit to at least one race this season. This will be your A race, it's fine if you also have B and C races but they should not take precedence over your A race.

Next our algorithm will use the dates of the races you provided to program your daily workouts following periodization principles. You can read more about the science behind this here:

The final step is up to you the athlete to follow the plan and enter in your training data. This can be mostly automated through one of our integrations.

### Training Programming

With the periodization algorithm Bowden can take your planned race season as inputs along with other parameters and generate daily training workouts that are based in science.

### Real-time Coaching

Using AI voice generation the user can upload a 2min sound bite of any voice they would like to have as a coach during a workout.
