Founded in the 1960's periodization training has been a pillar in sports science to this day. Itâ€™s concepts can be found in textbooks and are widely used by athletes of all skill levels. Since periodization training has a set of scientifically tested principles, we can break them down into an algorithm that computes daily training data leading to an optimal performance on race day. Many coaches (sometimes unknowingly) already use a form of the periodization algorithm to manually program workouts for their athletes in a seasonal calendar. Our goal is to demystify the process of planning a race season by sharing this algorithm publicly through open source code.
