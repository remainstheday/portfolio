description: Reviewing past race results can be notoriously difficult.

Reviewing past race results can be notoriously difficult. Even when the data is publicly available on most websites for all to see, you need patience to dig through archaic pages in hopes of finding useful information about a race. Take a look at the Dallas Marathon results from 2012 below for example. There were 4,875 people who finished a whole marathon that year! And yet these race results are not living up to their full potential. There are hundreds of marathon websites across the country each with thousands of participants and all the results are pretty much the same as this page if not worse. What makes this problem interesting is that the opportunity for engaging with these runners is very high. As an example any given race has a wealth of public demographic data that can uncover where people are traveling from to attend certain races. A public database of these results coupled with a large language model (LLM) could allow us to answer questions such as "Which states have the most runners who travel for races?"
