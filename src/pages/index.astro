            I am a full time software engineer, part time athlete, and constant

            of my time working with startups and training for endurance events.

            Online I have been the lead engineer for startups like
            EquityMultiple and Logly, I've also been employed by Fortune 100
            companies including Ogilvy and Twitter through the years. Lately my
            work has me exploring the potential for AI to improve how we
            interact with existing applications.
