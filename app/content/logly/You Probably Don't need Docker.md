_Disclaimer: The following insights are from my hands-on experience with diverse JavaScript production projects. Do your own research and testing with Docker._

Advocates of Docker will brag about its ability to sync dependencies across varying environments and simplify the build process. While these advantages seem promising theoretically, they can be misleading. Introducing Docker to a project with cluttered Node/NPM dependencies and an unstable build process often makes matters worse.

Many engineers championing Docker are likely avoiding their current NPM configurations. If you decided to use Docker, it's import to address these foundational issues.

### Package.json and Package-lock.json
The most common complaints in javascript land are around npm packages throwing "mismatched version" warnings/ errors. Before switching to Docker try cleaning up your packages with these tips instead:
- Purge unused packages with `npm prune`.
- Commit `package-lock.json` to GIT, keeping it current with `npm install`.
- Designate the ideal Node version for your app via `"engines": {"node": "16"}`.

### Console Hygiene
I promise you a pristine console devoid of errors or warnings is attainable. Before adopting Docker a major improvement that can benefit most projects is being able to run these commands without any errors or warnings:
- `npm ci` executes a clean install, eliminating any potential issues with module caching.
- `npm build` mimics a production build.
- `npm test` I recommend an end-to-end testing framework, such as Playwright.
- `npm start` launch the production build locally and test it out.

### Aligning Your Environments
Do you know which Node/NPM version is being used in your production environment?

Even if Docker standardizes a Node version across different environments it could be using the wrong version to run your application. For instance, an app developed on Node v16 might throw errors in the latest Docker Image operating on Node v18.

I personally favor Vercel for production, which defaults to v18 and use NVM locally to run the same version in development.

### Conclusion
Docker isn't a magic fix for NPM challenges and can even introduce new headaches. Before bringing Docker into a project take time to understand the Node/NPM ecosystem.
